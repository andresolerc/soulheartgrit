Every city or town should have a least one public calisthenic park.
These parks are usually not easy to find unless they are largely promoted by their locals but there is a good one found in the suburb of Elwood, #Melbourne, #Australia.
I will show you a quick demonstration of this park and what you can do here.

This park has long straight bars at different heights, mixing with parallel bars and a vertical ladder.
The straight bars are at the perfect height to do all sort of #calisthenic movements and the parallels are solid for a training with a thick grip.
Interestingly, the floor is made of a soft material, great for warmups, jumps and landings on barefoot.

After a dynamic warmup, working through a full range of motion movements.
We were ready to start with a full body workout exploring a larger group of muscles on #functional strength movements.
These exercises will also strengthen grip and wrists for #pull-ups,
traps for #handstands and core where these are key to support bigger #muscle groups.

On every exercise, the main focus is to perform them in a perfect form and to achieve technical failure.
Some essential key points are hand placement on a straight bar for pull-ups and muscle-ups.
Keep thumbs under the bar and all other fingers fully engaged, this way will help to engage forearms for a stronger grip.

Additionally, wrists should aim to be positioned at a 45-degree angle rather than being under the bar.
Palms will wrap the bar completely avoiding leaving any gaps, as it will increase power transfer from body to bar for an explosive pull.

There are plenty of strength skills to develop in a calisthenics park where anyone can start training to get stronger and look fit.
These exercises are just a few of hundred options to train for but still will give great body conditioning, as Elwood park has a great set of bars for anyone who wants to give a try. You are welcome to check this park and talk about your exercise routine.

This park is located in Bay Trail, Point Ormond, Elwood
