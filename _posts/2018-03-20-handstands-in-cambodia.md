It looks easy in the picture, but I was on the edge at a three-meter height.

"Whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go, just remember how far you've come. Remember everything you've faced, all the battles you've won, all the fears you've overcome."

Handstand walks are becoming more popular and a standard in Crossfit training. While there are no many options to do exercise during travelling, and a functional Crossfit box is still unavailable in this area of Cambodia. Yet, there is training that can be done while exploring new places.

Siem Reap is a small town located in north side of Cambodia, worldwide famous for its Angkor temples built by the Khmer culture which was dedicated to Hindu gods. Angkor Wat is one of the largest temple built in the 12th century (113-5BC) and it was looked after by Khmer Buddhists.

I have spent plenty of hours practicing straight handstands holds, using a wall as a support then I was able to focus on an active posture with my shoulders, trapezius, abdominals and legs towards achieving a straight line. This training is useful to get familiar with breathing while your head is downside about to kiss the floor.

But how can we start walking forward on a handstand? -Getting out of inertia and catching momentum is a purpose for moving forward #lifehack. To start with, a friend would be great to assist you by holding your legs, then you will able to focus on shifting from left to right, balancing and pressing down with your shoulders. Keeping your arms straight and fingers widely open is a good practice for catching balance.

Ideally, a perfect handstand walk should look like a straight solid pencil but this will come with time and practice. As a beginner, your heels can go forward allowing a reverse hollow to happen with your core fully engaged to prevent a lower back collapse and toes are required to be pointing out, complete this walk by chasing your heels.

Handstand walks are usually not included in Crossfit regular WOD's "workout of the day", however, they are a must skill to reach RX level "as prescribed weights and reps". The Crossfit games 2018 will include a handstand obstacle course again for elite athletes. Still a fun movement, better we keep training anywhere possible on daily basis.
