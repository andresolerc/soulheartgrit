![Richmond Boxing Club](/assets/images/RichmondBoxing20160820.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
One of my favorites boxing clubs, located in Melbourne.

Living overseas for about six years and traveling around Oceania, Asia, South America and Europe.

I have been shaping the life I want, through fitness coaching in Australia
for several years, exploring Asia, Europe and America.

Coaching people from different backgrounds adds such a great satisfaction.

My experience is in functional training where I am glad for achieving these certificates in Australia certified by [Fitness Australia][fitness-au] â€“ The Health & Fitness Industry Association.

My goals are to get more courses around the world this time...

* Certificate in fitness III with [Personal Training Academy][ptacademy]

* Kettlebell level 1 and 2 with [Tough Love Kettlebells][toughlove-kb]

* Boxing for personal trainers level 1 and 2 with [Fighting Fit for life][fight-life]

* Bulgarian bags with PD4PT's and Duncan McDaide from [The Functional Project][bulgarian-bag]

* Group outdoor training for PT's certification with [PD4PT's][pd4pts] Professional development for personal trainers.

* Myofascial release certification with [PD4PT's][pd4pts]
