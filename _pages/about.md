Living overseas for about six years and traveling around Oceania, Asia, South America and Europe.

I have been shaping the life I want, through fitness coaching in Australia
for several years, exploring Asia and Colombia and now from Amsterdam.

Coaching people from different backgrounds adds such a great satisfaction.

My experience is in functional training where I am glad for achieving these certificates in Australia, coming more...:

* Certificate in fitness III with Personal Training Academy

* Kettlebell level 1 and 2 with Tough Love Kettlebells

* Boxing for personal trainers level 1 and 2 with Fighting Fit for life

* Bulgarian bags with PD4PT's

* Group outdoor training for PT's with PD4PT's

* Myofascial release with PD4PT's
