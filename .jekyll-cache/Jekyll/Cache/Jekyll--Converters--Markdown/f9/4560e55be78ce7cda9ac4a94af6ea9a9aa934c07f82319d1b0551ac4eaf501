One of my favorites boxing clubs, located in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Living overseas for about six years and traveling around Oceania, Asia, South America and Europe.</p>

<p>I have been shaping the life I want, through fitness coaching in Australia
for several years, exploring Asia, Europe and America.</p>

<p>Coaching people from different backgrounds adds such a great satisfaction.</p>

<p>My experience is in functional training where I am glad for achieving these certificates in Australia certified by <a href="https://fitness.org.au/">Fitness Australia</a> â€“ The Health &amp; Fitness Industry Association.</p>
